# Atlas-Legis

**Atlas Legis** is an interactive, browser-based map of U.S. law schools designed to make legal education geographically and visually modern.

## Overview

Atlas Legis allows users to explore ABA-accredited law schools through a dynamic mapping interface. Users can pan, zoom, and interact with institutions in a way that traditional list-based or search-based websites do not support.

In short, I wanted to create an easily-accessible, in-depth geographic map of U.S. law schools that prospective law students could use as a resource.

## Features

* Interactive pan and zoom navigation
* Geographically accurate law school markers
* Clickable institutional data
* Custom filters
* Responsive browser interface
* Lightweight front-end design

## Purpose

Atlas Legis was developed as an independent legal-tech project to:

* Improve accessibility to law school location data
* Provide a modern research tool for prospective applicants
* Provide easily-accessible information regarding law schools

## Technology Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Mapping libraries

## Future Development

Planned expansions include:

* Compare-and-contrast feature
* The ability to "star" law schools so the user can come back later
* Note-taking feature to write down thoughts for later
